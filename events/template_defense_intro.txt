This is tower defense-type minigame. Players deploy a regular squad on students onto fixed battlefield locations, with the goal of stopping waves of enemies from reaching player base. 
Clearing three challenge stars of Normal stages will unlock the multiplier option that allows player to expend event currency and be granted rewards at selected multiplier level (x1~x{{defense_info['DefenseBattleMultiplierMax']}}).
